# Quiz Generator

### What is this awesome quiz generator?

- **Technologies**: We built this RESTful app using Rails and a Postgres database. We hit an external API to seed our database.
- **Features**
  - There are two types of users: instructors and students

    - Instructors are able to:
      - Log in and create a new account
      - If they are assigned a cohort already, they are taken to the page with the quizzes associated with the cohort. They can create new quizzes
      - If they do not have a cohort yet, they can create a new one and begin creating quizzes

    - Students are able to:
      - Log in and create a new account
      - See the quizzes associated with the cohort they are assigned to.
      - They can view individual quizzes

  - **Future features**
    - Students will be able to take a quiz and instructors will be able to grade those quizzes
    - When a new quiz is created, the students in the cohort will receive an email
    - A chart will be available for students to view their progress
